# Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋
I'm **Nicodemos Santos** (Yes, I know:'Where is the name 'Sávio'?' Sávio is a 'normal' name and I use as nickname, but this is a loong history \*spoiler: my father's 
fault\*).
<br/> I'm a developer with a passion for React, React Native ♥, Node, and Laravel. When I'm not coding, you can find at the nearest park or sunset view place, eating 
lasagna, or binge-watching
the latest sci-fi series on Netflix. But... Let's go!

## 🎉 My projects
Here are some of my latest projects that showcase my superpowers:

#### If you're here to see a little bit of the power of small screens you can see:
 - [Fast Todo](https://github.com/SavioNicodemos/fastTodo) - A beautiful and quick toDo app to quickly add, track and remove your daily things.
 - [Fast Teams](https://github.com/SavioNicodemos/fastTeams) - An app to add your group of football friends and track them all allowing to add in Team A and B and many groups you want.
 - [Go Barber](https://github.com/SavioNicodemos/gobarber-mobile) - (This is my old, but very robust son) An app to make an appointment with the barber you want in all available hours.
 - [Daily Diet](https://github.com/SavioNicodemos/dailyDiet) - (This is my new current baby) An app that makes YOU keep on track of you diet, adding dishes and informing if is inside of your diet ot not.

#### But... if you're looking for the big screens, or even no screens \*I want to see objects and HTTP responses in my postman NOW\* you can browse my repositories, but I will list everything here soon, come back in a few days, I will not let you down. Pinky promise!
